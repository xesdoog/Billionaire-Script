# Billionaire Services [WIP]
Lua script for YimMenu that provides billionaire services for GTA V players.

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress.

## Features:
### Private Jet service:
Props to R* for giving the players a 10M GTA$ golden jet that is completely useless and has no purpose. 
Well now it does have a purpose.

![billionaire_services](https://github.com/xesdoog/Billionaire-Script/assets/66764345/93dfa7b2-c52c-4130-9f71-7a57a40b7f95)

### Usage:
1. Choose an airport from the dropdown list. A [Luxor Deluxe](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/1/1f/LuxorDeluxe-GTAV-front.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20150614102306) will spawn there.
2. Go to your private jet *(It will be marked with a plane blip ![radar_player_plane](https://github.com/xesdoog/Billionaire-Script/assets/66764345/2cd7a70c-77c9-4c24-806d-fe744e216009)
 on the map).*
   > I will probably add a teleport option in the future.
4. Enter the jet then choose one of the options that will appear.
- Available options:
  - **Fly Around Waypoint**:
    - Place a waypoint on the map then press this button. Your pilot will take off and fly towards the waypoint. Unfortunately, you can't land a private jet wherever you want so when you get to your destination, the pilot will keep circling around the area.
  - **Land at one of the three airports available**:
    - Decide where you want to land your jet then press the corresponding airport button.
> [!NOTE]
> GTA V AI is a bit outdated. The pilot will sometimes struggle to find the correct runway approach and thus he will keep flying in circles while dangerously low until he either lands the jet or crashes it.

### Private Security service:

### Usage:
This feature has two main options for bodyguards:
1. **Spawn As Bodyguards**:
   - Select a group from the dropdown list then press **Spawn As Bodyguards**.
   - A group of 3 peds will spawn and follow you everywhere you go while also protecting you from the dangers that loom around Los Santos. Each group has a different type of weapon but they are all equally skilled at shooting people.
3. **Spawn As Escorts**:
   - Select a group from the dropdown list then press **Spawn As Escorts**. This group has their own vehicle which they will not leave. They can follow you if you get in a car yourself and start driving.
   - You can get inside the escort car to do some fun things. Escorts can drive you around town, chauffeur you to your waypoint, do a burnout or start a random driveby shooting on innocent civilians. There's also an option to start doing donuts but to be able to do them in GTA, you need a lot of torque which I had issues modifying for the escort car. If you want to see how this option is supposed to work, **you can use YimMenu to add more acceleration**:
     - While sitting inside the escort car, go to YimMenu's Vehicle tab > Handing > Other and set the acceleration multiplier to 4 or more. Enjoy mad donuts until I figure out how to properly implement it.

### Private Limo service:

![billionaire_services(2)](https://github.com/xesdoog/Billionaire-Script/assets/66764345/07b1c8f3-6511-4dd6-9a4f-c7f86d84898d)

### Usage:
1. Press the button to call for a limo. A Patriot Stretch will spawn in front of you.
2. Approach one of the rear doors and press F to enter the vehicle.
 - Two options will aprear:
   - **Drive To Waypoint**:
      - Set a waypoint on the map then press this button to travel to it. The driver will obey traffic laws and get you there safely.
   - **Cruise Around**:
      - Simply does what it says. The driver will take you for a ride around town.

## Known Issues:
- It's probably too early for listing issues at the moment.
